# Repository for Component Rendering Issue In Edge Browser

## Issue
Stencil component is not getting rendered in Edge (Version 41.16299.1480.0). 

## Steps to reproduce
1. ` git clone `
2. ` npm install`
3. ` npm run build --es5`
4. Host the dist folder to anywhere of your choice (I have used live server extension of vscode)
5. change the js hosted path in `test.html` file

P.S. I have tested that component is getting rendered in Chrome/IE
